# Glfw App

This repository contains a simple GLFW OpenGL application with models, lights and shadows.

# Why?

Before this project I had no experience with OpenGL or graphic programming in general.
Someone asked me to do this project in exchange for money. I got around $50.

# Running

Use CMake to build and run this project. Keep in mind that both GLFW and ASSIMP need to be installed.

## Controls

WASD to move Forward, Backward, Left, Right
Arrow Keys (Up Down Left Right) to change where Camera is looking
Hold Shift to Sprint (Move Fast)
Press Ctrl to TOGGLE between Fly camera and Walk camera
PgUp, PgDn, Home, End to change Light Positions

# Issues

1. Some of the code is low quality and needs refactoring.
2. The shaders were made in a hurry and they require changes.
3. The models don't have proper textures or materials.
